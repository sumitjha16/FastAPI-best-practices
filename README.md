# FastAPI Comprehensive Guide: From Setup to Production

## Introduction to FastAPI

FastAPI is like a supercharged toolkit for building web APIs in Python. Imagine you're building a bridge between different software systems - FastAPI gives you the strongest, most flexible materials to build that bridge quickly and efficiently. It's become the go-to choice for developers because it combines speed with simplicity, automatically handles documentation, and uses Python's type hints to catch errors before they happen.

Think of it like this: if regular API frameworks are manual cars, FastAPI is a self-driving electric sports car. It does the hard work for you while giving you top performance.

## Setting Up FastAPI

Getting started with FastAPI is like setting up a new kitchen - you just need the basic tools to start cooking up APIs. The installation is straightforward because FastAPI is designed to get you from zero to API hero in minutes.

Why is proper setup important? Just like you wouldn't build a house without a solid foundation, setting up your development environment correctly ensures everything that comes after works smoothly. The basic setup includes:

1. FastAPI itself (the framework)
2. Uvicorn (the ASGI server that runs your code)
3. A virtual environment (to keep your project's dependencies organized)

Here's how simple it is to get started:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

This tiny bit of code gives you:
- A working API endpoint
- Automatic documentation
- Data validation
- All the performance benefits of async Python

## Project Structure

Organizing your FastAPI project is like organizing a workshop - you want every tool in its right place so you can find it when you need it. A messy project becomes hard to maintain as it grows, while a well-structured one makes collaboration and scaling painless.

Imagine your API is a growing business. At first, you might handle everything yourself, but as you grow, you need departments (modules) for specific functions. The structure we recommend creates natural separation between:

- API routes (your public interface)
- Database models (your data storage)
- Business logic (your services)
- Configuration (your settings)

Here's why this matters:
- New team members can find things quickly
- Changes in one area don't accidentally break others
- Testing becomes easier when components are isolated
- Deployment gets simpler when everything has its place

## Routing and Endpoints

Routes are like the doors to your API - they define how clients can interact with your application. Well-designed routes make your API intuitive to use, while messy ones can confuse developers and lead to mistakes.

Think of your API as a restaurant menu. Good endpoints are like well-organized menu sections (Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts), while poor ones are like throwing all dishes together randomly. The standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) correspond to the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that form the backbone of most APIs.

Here's how to create clear, purposeful endpoints:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return [{"item_id": "Foo"}]

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: dict):
    return item

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: dict):
    return {"item_id": item_id, **item}

@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
async def delete_item(item_id: int):
    return {"message": "Item deleted"}
```

Key principles for good routing:
- Use nouns (not verbs) in path names
- Keep URLs consistent and predictable
- Version your API from the start (/v1/items)
- Group related routes together

## Data Validation with Pydantic

Data validation is like having a bouncer for your API - it checks everything coming in meets your standards before letting it through. Pydantic models are these bouncers, ensuring bad data never gets into your system where it could cause problems.

Imagine someone sending a string when you expect a number, or forgetting required fields. Without validation, these issues might cause crashes or corrupt your database. With Pydantic, invalid data gets stopped at the door with clear error messages.

Here's how it works:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    price: float
    tax: Optional[float] = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

Benefits of Pydantic validation:
- Catches errors early
- Provides automatic documentation
- Converts data to the right types
- Supports complex nested data structures
- Works seamlessly with FastAPI's dependency system

## Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is like having a personal assistant for your code - instead of creating everything yourself, you declare what you need, and FastAPI provides it. This makes your code more modular, easier to test, and less prone to errors.

Imagine building a car where each part magically appears when needed, rather than having to wire everything together manually. That's dependency injection - it handles the wiring so you can focus on the important stuff.

Here's a simple example:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

async def common_parameters(q: Optional[str] = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    return commons
```

Why dependency injection matters:
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes testing easier (you can mock dependencies)
- Keeps business logic separate from infrastructure
- Makes your code more maintainable
- Supports reuse across different routes

## Database Integration

Databases are the memory of your application - they store everything important. Setting them up properly is crucial because database problems can be some of the hardest to fix later. SQLAlchemy is like the universal translator between Python and databases - it lets you work with different database systems using the same Python code.

Think of your database connection like a phone line to your data - you want it clear and reliable. Connection pooling ensures you don't waste time establishing new connections for every request, which would be like hanging up and redialing for every sentence in a conversation.

Here's the proper setup:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./sql_app.db"

engine = create_engine(
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False}
)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

Base = declarative_base()
```

Key database best practices:
- Use connection pooling
- Keep session handling separate from business logic
- Always close sessions when done
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Consider async database drivers for better performance

## Role-Based Access
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables secure resource access based on user roles and their associated permissions. This guide demonstrates a practical RBAC implementation in FastAPI, including user authentication, token management, and permission validation.

User Data and Models Users are associated with roles and permissions. In a real-world app, this data would be stored in a database.
```python
import datetime
from typing import List, Dict
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from pydantic import BaseModel
import jwt
import bcrypt

app = FastAPI()

# Simulated in-memory user data
users_db = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "admin",
        "hashed_password": bcrypt.hashpw(b"admin123", bcrypt.gensalt()).decode(),
        "roles": ["admin"],
        "permissions": ["read:items", "write:items", "read:users"]
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "username": "editor",
        "hashed_password": bcrypt.hashpw(b"editor123", bcrypt.gensalt()).decode(),
        "roles": ["editor"],
        "permissions": ["read:items", "write:items"]
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "viewer",
        "hashed_password": bcrypt.hashpw(b"viewer123", bcrypt.gensalt()).decode(),
        "roles": ["viewer"],
        "permissions": ["read:items"]
    }
]

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    roles: List[str]
    permissions: List[str]
```
Authentication and Token Handling Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens with payloads containing role and permission information.

```python
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="login")

def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> User:
    for user in users_db:
        if user["username"] == username and bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode(), user["hashed_password"].encode()):
            return User(username=user["username"], roles=user["roles"], permissions=user["permissions"])
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Invalid username or password"
    )

def create_access_token(data: dict) -> str:
    payload = {
        "sub": data["username"],
        "roles": data["roles"],
        "permissions": data["permissions"],
        "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)
    }
    token = jwt.encode(payload, "secret_key", algorithm="HS256")
    return token

class LoginRequest(BaseModel):
 username: str
 password: str

 @app.post("/login")
 def login(request: LoginRequest):
     user = authenticate_user(request.username, request.password)
     token = create_access_token(user.dict())
     return {"access_token": token, "token_type": "bearer"}
```

Permission Checker A custom dependency to validate required permissions before accessing protected resources.

```python
class PermissionChecker:
    def __init__(self, required_permissions: List[str]) -> None:
        self.required_permissions = required_permissions

    def __call__(self, token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)) -> None:
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, "secret_key", algorithms=["HS256"])
            user_permissions = payload.get("permissions", [])
            for perm in self.required_permissions:
                if perm not in user_permissions:
                    raise HTTPException(
                        status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                        detail=f"Permission '{perm}' is required"
                    )
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Token has expired")
        except jwt.DecodeError:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
```
Secure API Endpoints Endpoints are secured based on user roles and permissions.

```python
@app.get("/items", dependencies=[Depends(PermissionChecker(["read:items"]))])
def read_items():
    return {"message": "You can view items"}

@app.post("/items", dependencies=[Depends(PermissionChecker(["write:items"]))])
def create_item():
    return {"message": "You can create items"}

@app.get("/users", dependencies=[Depends(PermissionChecker(["read:users"]))])
def read_users():
    return {"message": "You can view users"}
```

## Authentication and Security

Security is like the lock on your front door - you wouldn't leave your house unlocked, and you shouldn't leave your API unprotected. Authentication ensures only the right people can access your API, while authorization controls what they can do once they're in.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are like digital ID cards - they contain verified information about the user that your API can trust. They're particularly useful for APIs because they're stateless (your server doesn't need to remember them) and can contain custom data.

Here's a complete JWT authentication system:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from jose import jwt
from passlib.context import CryptContext

# Configuration
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

def verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)

def get_password_hash(password):
    return pwd_context.hash(password)

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta] = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt

async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    credentials_exception = HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Could not validate credentials",
        headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
    )
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise credentials_exception
    except JWTError:
        raise credentials_exception
    user = get_user(username)
    if user is None:
        raise credentials_exception
    return user
```

##Implement MFA Logic
Register Users: Allow users to register and generate a unique OTP secret.
Login: Validate username and password, and then request OTP.
Verify OTP: Verify the OTP provided by the user.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
import pyotp

app = FastAPI()

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.post("/register")
def register_user(username: str, password: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    otp_secret = pyotp.random_base32()
    new_user = User(username=username, password=password, otp_secret=otp_secret)
    db.add(new_user)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_user)
    return {"message": "User registered!", "otp_secret": otp_secret}

@app.post("/login")
def login_user(username: str, password: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    user = db.query(User).filter(User.username == username).first()
    if not user or user.password != password:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid credentials")
    return {"message": "Login successful, provide OTP"}

@app.post("/verify-otp")
def verify_otp(username: str, otp: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    user = db.query(User).filter(User.username == username).first()
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    totp = pyotp.TOTP(user.otp_secret)
    if not totp.verify(otp):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid OTP")
    user.is_otp_verified = True
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "OTP verified successfully"}
```

Security essentials:
- Always hash passwords (never store them plaintext)
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set appropriate token expiration times
- Handle token revocation for sensitive applications
- Consider rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## Error Handling

Error handling is like having a good insurance policy - you hope you never need it, but when things go wrong, you'll be glad it's there. Good error handling means your API fails gracefully with helpful messages, rather than crashing or exposing sensitive information.

Imagine a restaurant where the waiter politely explains they're out of a dish, versus one that just throws a tantrum. Your API should be the polite waiter - even when things go wrong, it should communicate clearly about what happened and how to fix it.

Here's how to implement comprehensive error handling:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={"message": exc.detail},
    )

@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=422,
        content={"detail": exc.errors(), "message": "Validation error"},
    )

class CustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, status_code: int, detail: str):
        self.status_code = status_code
        self.detail = detail

@app.exception_handler(CustomException)
async def custom_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={"message": exc.detail},
    )
```

Error handling best practices:
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using broad try/except
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Don't expose stack traces or sensitive information in production
- Use standard HTTP status codes appropriately

## Middleware

Middleware is like a series of checkpoints that every request passes through before reaching your main code. It's perfect for cross-cutting concerns that apply to many routes - things like logging, authentication, or adding common headers.

Think of middleware like airport security - every passenger (request) goes through the same checks before reaching their gate (your route handlers). This centralized approach is more efficient than implementing the same checks in every route.

Here's a logging middleware example:

```python
import logging
import json
from datetime import datetime
from fastapi import Request
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
import time
import uuid

logger = logging.getLogger("api")

class LogMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        request.state.request_id = request_id
        
        start_time = time.time()
        
        logger.info(json.dumps({
            "request_id": request_id,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "event": "request_started",
            "method": request.method,
            "path": request.url.path,
            "client_ip": request.client.host,
        }))
        
        try:
            response = await call_next(request)
            process_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            logger.info(json.dumps({
                "request_id": request_id,
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "event": "request_completed",
                "method": request.method,
                "path": request.url.path,
                "status_code": response.status_code,
                "processing_time": process_time
            }))
            
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            process_time = time.time() - start_time
            logger.error(json.dumps({
                "request_id": request_id,
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "event": "request_failed",
                "method": request.method,
                "path": request.url.path,
                "error": str(e),
                "processing_time": process_time
            }))
            raise

app.add_middleware(LogMiddleware)
```

Common middleware uses:
- Request logging
- Authentication/authorization
- CORS handling
- Rate limiting
- Response compression
- Adding security headers

## Testing

Testing your API is like quality control in a factory - it ensures everything works as expected before reaching your users. Good tests catch bugs early, document how your API should behave, and give you confidence to make changes without breaking things.

Imagine building a car without testing the brakes - you wouldn't know they fail until it's too late. Similarly, untested API endpoints might work fine in happy scenarios but fail catastrophically with unexpected input.

Here's a complete testing setup:

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool

from app.main import app
from app.db.database import Base, get_db

# Test database setup
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"
engine = create_engine(
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
    poolclass=StaticPool,
)
TestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def override_get_db():
    try:
        db = TestingSessionLocal()
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db

client = TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def test_db():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    yield
    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)

def test_create_user(test_db):
    response = client.post(
        "/users/",
        json={"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["email"] == "test@example.com"

def test_read_users(test_db):
    response = client.get("/users/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(response.json(), list)
```

Testing best practices:
- Test both success and failure cases
- Keep tests isolated and independent
- Use a separate test database
- Test at different levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Run tests automatically in CI/CD pipelines
- Aim for high code coverage but focus on critical paths

## Background Tasks

Background tasks are like having an assistant who handles time-consuming jobs while you focus on more important work. They're perfect for operations that don't need to complete before sending a response to the client, like sending emails or processing uploads.

Imagine a restaurant where the waiter takes your order (the API request) and immediately gives you a number (the response), while the kitchen (background task) prepares your food. This approach keeps the waiter free to serve other customers rather than waiting in the kitchen.

FastAPI provides two approaches:

1. Simple BackgroundTasks for quick operations:

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

def write_notification(email: str, message=""):
    with open("log.txt", mode="w") as email_file:
        content = f"notification for {email}: {message}"
        email_file.write(content)

@app.post("/send-notification/{email}")
async def send_notification(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(write_notification, email, message="some notification")
    return {"message": "Notification sent in the background"}
```

2. Celery for complex, long-running tasks:

```python
from celery import Celery

celery_app = Celery(
    "worker",
    broker="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    backend="redis://localhost:6379/0"
)

@celery_app.task
def process_data(data):
    # Heavy processing task
    return {"processed": True}

@app.post("/process")
async def process_endpoint(data: dict):
    task = process_data.delay(data)
    return {"task_id": task.id}
```

When to use background tasks:
- Sending emails/notifications
- Processing file uploads
- Data analysis/report generation
- Any operation that takes more than a few hundred milliseconds
- Tasks that might need retry logic

## Caching Strategies

Caching is like keeping frequently used tools on your workbench instead of in the garage - it saves time by keeping often-needed data close at hand. A good caching strategy can dramatically improve your API's performance by reducing database load and speeding up responses.

Imagine a library where popular books are kept on a front display shelf rather than reshelved after each use. Caching works similarly - frequently accessed data stays readily available.

Here's a Redis caching implementation:

```python
from fastapi import Request, Response
import hashlib
import json
from redis import Redis

redis = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def generate_cache_key(request: Request):
    url = str(request.url)
    query_params = str(request.query_params)
    return hashlib.md5(f"{url}:{query_params}".encode()).hexdigest()

@app.get("/cached-data")
async def get_cached_data(request: Request):
    cache_key = generate_cache_key(request)
    cached_result = redis.get(cache_key)
    if cached_result:
        return json.loads(cached_result)
    
    # Simulate expensive operation
    result = {"data": "This is expensive to compute"}
    redis.setex(cache_key, 300, json.dumps(result))  # Cache for 5 minutes
    return result
```

Caching best practices:
- Cache at different levels (database queries, API responses)
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Invalidate cache when data changes
- Consider what to cache (read-heavy data is ideal)
- Monitor cache hit/miss ratios
- Use different cache backends for different needs (Redis for distributed, memory for simple)

## Performance Optimization

Optimizing your FastAPI application is like tuning a race car - small adjustments can lead to significant speed improvements. Performance matters because faster APIs mean happier users, lower infrastructure costs, and better scalability.

Key areas to focus on:
- Database access (the most common bottleneck)
- Algorithm efficiency
- Parallel processing
- Resource usage

Here's how to optimize database access with async:

```python
from databases import Database

database = Database('postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname')

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    await database.connect()

@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown():
    await database.disconnect()

@app.get("/users/")
async def read_users():
    query = "SELECT * FROM users"
    return await database.fetch_all(query=query)
```

And connection pooling for traditional SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(
    "postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname",
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=20,
    pool_recycle=300
)
```

Performance optimization tips:
- Profile before optimizing (find the real bottlenecks)
- Use async database drivers where possible
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for heavy read loads
- Use indexes wisely in your database
- Limit the data returned (don't SELECT * unless needed)
- Implement pagination for large result sets

## Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring is like having a dashboard in your car - it shows you what's happening under the hood so you can spot problems before they become serious. Good monitoring helps you understand how your API performs in production, where bottlenecks are, and when something goes wrong.

Logging provides the paper trail you need to debug issues. Imagine trying to solve a mystery with no clues - that's debugging without logs. Structured logging makes it easier to search and analyze log data.

Here's a Prometheus metrics setup:

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
import time

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
    'http_request_total', 
    'Total HTTP Requests', 
    ['method', 'endpoint', 'status']
)
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'http_request_duration_seconds', 
    'HTTP Request Latency', 
    ['method', 'endpoint']
)

class PrometheusMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        start_time = time.time()
        response = await call_next(request)
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        
        REQUEST_LATENCY.labels(
            method=request.method, 
            endpoint=request.url.path
        ).observe(duration)
        
        REQUEST_COUNT.labels(
            method=request.method, 
            endpoint=request.url.path, 
            status=response.status_code
        ).inc()
        
        return response

app.add_middleware(PrometheusMiddleware)

@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics():
    return Response(content=generate_latest(), media_type="text/plain")
```

Monitoring essentials:
- Track key metrics (request rate, latency, errors)
- Set up alerts for abnormal conditions
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Include correlation IDs to trace requests
- Monitor both application and infrastructure metrics
- Set up dashboards for visualization

## Deployment

Deploying your FastAPI application is like opening a new store location - you need the right infrastructure, security, and scalability to handle real customers (users). A proper deployment ensures your API is available, performant, and secure in production.

Key considerations:
- Containerization (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes if needed)
- Reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Process management
- Environment configuration

Here's a Docker setup:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser
USER appuser

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

And docker-compose.yml for local development:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/app
    depends_on:
      - db
    restart: always
    
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=app
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Production deployment tips:
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper secret management
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- Consider serverless options for variable workloads
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero downtime updates
- Set up proper backups and disaster recovery

## Production Best Practices

Running FastAPI in production is like maintaining a high-performance vehicle - it needs regular checkups, proper fuel (resources), and attention to warning signs. These best practices help ensure your API remains stable, secure, and performant under real-world conditions.

Key areas to focus on:
1. **Security**: Like locking your doors at night
2. **Reliability**: Ensuring your API is always available
3. **Performance**: Keeping response times fast
4. **Maintainability**: Making future updates easier

Here's a health check endpoint that monitors your API's vital signs:

```python
from fastapi import status
from sqlalchemy import text

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    health = {
        "status": "ok",
        "database": False,
    }
    
    try:
        db.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
        health["database"] = True
    except Exception as e:
        health["status"] = "degraded"
        health["database_error"] = str(e)
    
    if health["status"] != "ok":
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE,
            content=health
        )
    
    return health
```

Production checklist:
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (TLS)
- [ ] Set up proper monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement logging with rotation
- [ ] Configure backups
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Use a proper secrets management system
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Document your API thoroughly
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Perform regular load testing
- [ ] Have a rollback plan for deployments
